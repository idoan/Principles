# Makkajai Employee Handbook

For the first 5 years of our life, we haven't had a handbook. This meant that our priorities, practices and sometimes even Strategy, just evolved without concious planning. When everything is left to interpretation, people end up interpreting them in different ways. 

We rebooted our company and team in 2019, with a focus on profitable and sustainable growth. Most of our team is new - and we are now operating in a way that is so different from most companies in India, that it makes sense to have a baseline to draw from.

Hence this handbook - this is a compilation of philosophy, principles and rituals that we hold dear. This handbook should answer basic questions like - What behavior is encouraged in this company? What is our mission? How do I contribute the most to fulfilling our mission? How does my team support me in doing such work? and so on. 

As all large efforts, this is a live document. Inspired by the Basecamp way of doing things, we will think of our company's operating system in terms of versions - and will keep improving the version (literally) as we make improvements in the way we work.
