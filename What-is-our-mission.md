# What is our mission?

We want to make learning really fun for kids. 

Kids have an innate sense of wonder and curiosity. They cannot stop asking "what" or "why" at an early age - and yet once they go through the current industrial model of schooling, they tend to lose that sense of wonder; they start dreading "studying" - and spend time learning only because they have to, not because they want to. This might not be the situation in every country and in every single house, however, this does seem to be the trend. 

Sir Ken Robinson's TED talk on this topic is a wonderful eye opener. See the [illustrated version of the talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/sir_ken_robinson_changing_education_paradigms). 

Our mission is to contribute to this movement by creating amazing learning content. Content that kids love, ask more of - content that keeps alive their sense of wonder, awakens more curiosity, removes fear of failure - and inculcates a growth mindset. And to create content that can eventually reach all kids on this planet. 

As the first part of this journey, we are creating incredibly fun Math games; games that help kids get better at Math, practice and learn different concepts, and have fun at the same time. The quality bar is simple - kids should ask more of it, should benefit from it, and should never be forced to use it. 

**Our current mission** - create a personalized Math curriculum filled with incredibly fun and well designed games, for kids aged 10 and younger.
