##Monster Math Design principles

Refer: Brand principles


1. We create Math learning games for kids - Math learning is essential. 

	Games that do not help with Math practice or learning; or are not designed for kids or are not games but only worksheets or activities - are not in our scope. 


2. Avoid bribery in the form of fun elements only being a reward for doing boring Math work - instead make the learning/practice elements core to the mechanic that is also fun. This should also improve time on task. For e.g. Prodigy - It has a great game play but kids have to do boring math worksheets to move forward. Don’t do this!

3. Tell a story! Kids love stories, especially ones with dialogues. Keep audio dialogues in, even if it’s a PITA to localize. Pay attention to the script arc and the dialogues - it’s important to have really fun and whimsical dialogues. 

	Note: It’s good to hire professional script writers to create fun dialogues. 

4. Monster Math takes place in the Monster Universe. Pay attention to the universe that these game characters and stories are part of. 

	All the apps are connected to each other in some way. Let each story develop the universe further. 


5. Let characters develop over the story. Let the kids identify with at least a few of the characters. 


6. Gender Neutral. Do not design with a particular gender in mind. Do not reinforce gender stereotypes, even inadvertently. (e.g. MM1 fails big time here). 


7. Go for “Calm Excitement” experience. 

8. Avoid extreme time-pressure - or things that can create unnecessary stress. On the other hand, keep action lively and exciting for kids. The balance is important to keep them engaged without stressing them out. 


9. Pick an art style that’s simpler, easier and faster to create good looking art in. Keep them 2d, Child-friendly - not too bright. 

10. Avoid human looking characters. Monsters or other fantasy characters can more easily look natural. 


11. Focus on primary and secondary colors (kids can perceive them better) than pastels or muted colors. 


12. Emphasize growth mindset over fixed mindset. 

13. Stories that show characters learning, and getting better (maybe even overcoming their own doubts) over characters who are already “smart” or powerful. MM1 does this well. 


14. Design for accessibility, as much as reasonably possible. 


	- What if a child is color blind? Design such that colors alone do not indicate what elements are interactive, for e.g. 

	- Note that 1 in 12 boys are color blind (1 in 200 girls). It’s much more prevalent than we might think. 


	- What if a child is hard of hearing? Add visual cues, so that the game/activity can be played even without sound, and sound only enhances the experience. 


	- What if the child is dyslexic? Add large, legible fonts, ensure that instructions are easy to read - and augmented by audio cues. 


	- No flashing animations that could potentially cause epilepsy. 


	These audiences are not nearly served as well as they should be by traditional learning. Serve them as well as we reasonably can.

15. No religious or political statements within the games or the stories.
