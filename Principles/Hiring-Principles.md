## Key ideas:
* Prioritize Learnability, willingness to grow out of comfort zone.
* Culture fit is extremely important.
* Missionaries over Mercenaries. 
* Trust is not optional.
* Communication and Discipline for effective work in a Remote-first setup.
* Treat all candidates with respect, even the ones we reject.


## Principles
* **Test for learnability.** Try to design test projects and iterate with feedback to see if the candidate can learn fast, as well as take feedback well. 
* **Test for existing knowledge, only to see if their foundations are strong, and to check for demonstration of learnability in their career.** Depending on the experience we are looking for, expectations will increase - if they are learnable, they would have picked a few skills along the way. If they are lesser experienced, focus more on ability to figure things out and learn, than existing knowledge. 
* **Communicate with written format**, say over email, 2-3 times with the candidate, before the interviews. Ensure their written communication is crisp and clear. 
* **Honesty is important.** Let them know upfront that you want honesty, so that the expectation is made clear. Make them comfortable, so that they are under no pressure to lie - then see if they communicate openly about difficult things, such as mistakes they have made, credit for projects on their resume and so on.
* **Discipline is important.** Do they show up on time for the interview, or at least communicate upfront about any delays? Do they send in submissions when they promised to send it in? Do they show evidence of sticking to their goals when facing something difficult, in any part of their life?
* **Share feedback fast and openly.** Close maybe's as a No. Communicate quickly and respectfully to any candidates that we are rejecting; even if we can't work with them, thank them for their time. 
* **DO NOT** - reject candidates just because they are not like you, or you don't like their personality or you can't see yourself being friends with them. We should welcome diversity in whatever way possible. It is more important that the people we hire align on our work and culture principles, than our personal tastes. 

**For example** - we can reject a candidate that seems extremely rude, communicates really badly, doesn't demonstrate learnability, lacks discipline or lies about things on their resume and gets caught only when we dig deeper. We should absolutely not reject a candidate based on their gender, religion, race, age, looks, food choices, hobbies and so on - things that in no way determines how suitable they are for the work we have. 

* For senior candidates, especially, and if possible for all, ask for references. The aim is to learn more about the candidate from people who might be knowing them better.
