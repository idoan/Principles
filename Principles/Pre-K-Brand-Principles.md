##Pre-K Brand principles

This is what we aspire our Pre-K brand to be - our design principles can flow from these. 

Till we build some apps for Pre-K this is draft and will undergo more modification. 

1. **Fun learning.** Kids love to explore the environment and play the activity with no coercion, and learn basic Math elements. 

	Kids come first; parents and teachers second. 

2. **Child-friendly design.** No violence or sexually suggestive themes, religious or political themes, nothing even mildly inappropriate. No blood or gore or any other references inappropriate for kids - no cartoon violence. 

3. Focused on kids in the **ages 3-5**. 

4. **High repeat play value**. Activity remains fun even if done repeatedly. 

5. Strong elements of **free play**. 

6. **Gender neutral**. Strongly discouraging social stereotypes. 

7. **Extremely Privacy conscious**. Keep userâ€™s privacy first. Comply with all privacy laws, in letter and in spirit. 

8. Encourage offline play in addition to digital play.
