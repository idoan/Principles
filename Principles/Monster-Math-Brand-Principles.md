## Monster Math Brand Principles

This is what we aspire to be - our design principles can flow from these. 

1. **Kids come first**; parents and teachers second. 


2. **No third party Ads**. 


3. **Anti Worksheets**. We hate boring worksheets. IXL, Prodigy and other worksheet apps suck. 


4. Encouraging **love of Math** and **Growth mindset**. 

	For e.g. journey of Maxx in MM1 from “I am not good at math” to “Remember MATH IS POWER...”


5. **Gender neutral**. Do not design targeting a particular gender, or let stereotypes creep in. 


6. **Paranoid about Privacy**. Customer data belongs to customers. We can only be custodians of their data. Go beyond just complying with privacy laws. 


7. **Affordable**. Not “cheap”, especially compared to other apps. Not beyond affordability either.
