## Pre-K Design principles


1. **Fun, Goal-oriented, Math activities** for kids - Math learning is essential, so is Fun. 

	Apps that do not help with Math learning; or are not designed for kids or are not Fun to play - are not in our current scope. 

2. **Keep the core element fun**. If the core element is not fun, nothing else is worth it. 

	Once the core element is fun, add enough attention to detail. Make sure that there is something to touch here, and something to discover there. 


3. **Keep things simple** - design keeping in mind that Kids that young have smaller working memories; making things complicated or expecting them to remember a mission, for e.g. can be really difficult for them. Let them play in the moment. 


4. **Keep elements of discovery and Free play** - the environment should be fun enough that doing things and discovering reactions is fun. 


5. **Gender neutral**. Do not design with a particular gender in mind. Do not reinforce gender stereotypes, even inadvertently. (e.g. MM1 fails big time here). 


6. **Pick an art style that’s simpler**, easier and faster to create good looking art in. 

	Keep them flat, 2d. Child-friendly - not too bright; not too dull either. 
	
	Avoid human looking characters. Monsters or other fantasy characters can more easily look natural. 

7. **Focus on primary and secondary colors** (kids can perceive them better) than pastels or muted colors. 

8. Go for “**Calm exploration**”. 

	Avoid time-pressure - or things that can create unnecessary stress. On the other hand, keep the environment exploratory for kids. Can avoid story or other progressional elements, to keep things exploratory. 


9. **Emphasize growth mindset over fixed mindset. **

	For example: Avoid messaging that says “you are smart” for e.g. and focus on “well done” or “good work”; or when they get it wrong, something like “Let’s try again!”. 

	Subtle but important shift in the way of recognizing failure vs success. 


10. **Design for accessibility**, as much as reasonably possible. Not at the expense of the experience being fun. 


	- What if a child is color blind? Design such that colors alone do not indicate what elements are interactive, for e.g. 

	- Note that 1 in 12 boys are color blind (1 in 200 girls). It’s much more prevalent than we might think. 


	- What if a child is hard of hearing? Add visual cues, so that the game/activity can be played even without sound, and sound only enhances the experience. 


	- What if the child is dyslexic? Add large, legible fonts, ensure that instructions are easy to read - and augmented by audio cues. 


	- No flashing animations that could potentially cause epilepsy. 


	These audiences are not nearly served as well as they should be by traditional learning. Serve them as well as we reasonably can.
