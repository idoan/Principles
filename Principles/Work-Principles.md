## Principles
1. **Communicate well** - Asynchronous as much as possible

	Communicate asynchronously as much as possible. Plan for eventual reply, rather than expecting immediate reply. 
	
	Similarly, ensure you reply eventually in the day - or in 2-3 days for threads that expect more thoughtful replies. Do not remain completely absent. 
	
	No decisions made on Slack - confirm all decisions on Basecamp so there is a written log, and others can jump in on their own time. The more important a discussion the more it stays off Slack.  
	
	If something is truly urgent - like it might be in 3.5% (!) of the cases - call. Similarly, keep your phone available. However do not abuse this ability to call - reserve it only for truly urgent matters. 
	
	Writing well is crucial for asynchronous communication. Other things like illustrations or photos explaining things or ideas can also help. Take the time to communicate thoughtfully, and keep improving your written communication skills. 


2. **Prioritize well** Focus excessively on the things that matter; ignore things that don’t. There is no greater waste than doing something well, that doesn’t need to be done at all. 

3. **Everyone controls their own time** Do not block anyone’s time without confirming with them first. 

	Aim for an average of about 40 hours of work per week; 8 X 5. 
	There are lots of ways to slice each hour though, 1x60 or 2x30 or 4x15 etc. The quality of the hour we are after is 1x60. 
	Protect your time and plan for large periods of undisturbed work. 3-4 continuous hours of undisturbed work are best. This is also why asynchronous communication is best - engage in your own time, no need to respond immediately. Design your communication for eventual response. 
	
	**Minimize meetings**; and even more so, recurring meetings. 
	
	Use 7 minutes if that’s all you need - don’t round it off to 10 or 15 minutes. End meetings early if the purpose is done. End meetings on time even if the discussion is tending to continue - take time to reflect and continue discussing asynchronously. 
	
	Cancel meetings that do not serve a purpose. Try to keep meetings to the first thing in the day or last thing in the day, when scheduling, to avoid breaking the day into multiple unproductive chunks. 
	
	At the same time - if you have scheduled to attend a meeting, respect others’ time and do not cancel without intimation. Also prepare the agenda upfront and share it with all participants - as well as try and do all the preparatory work upfront to minimize time taken from all. 

4. **Aim for Flow** -  Eliminate distractions. Feel free to turn off slack notifications, basecamp notifications, phone notifications and anything else that might distract you from work. 
	
	Work from a place that aids distraction-free work. Comfortable, noise-free environment, table and chair at the right heights with proper back support is best. 
	
	Try and create some routine around work. 

5. **Substance/Quality over quantity:** Do not judge others by the time they spend working. Judge and be ready to be judged by your colleagues, only by the quality and effectiveness of your work. 

6. **Trust:** No one needs to know where you are every second of the time. There is no need to ask for permission or even inform, if you need to step away from the desk for a few minutes, an hour, or even a few hours. 

	If you don’t reply to a ping, or an email in a few minutes, we won’t know whether it’s because you are not available at that moment, or just engrossed in some other work. And we don’t care. Just be sure to get back. If it’s really urgent, someone will call. 

7. **Feedback:** Ask for feedback thoughtfully. Consider sharing work early. Provide enough context, be clear on what you are seeking feedback; if it’s not clear, there is a chance no one will engage. 

	Consider all feedback. Use your judgement on which feedback to act upon. Focus on the appropriateness of the feedback itself rather than the person who gives the feedback. 
	
	Give feedback thoughtfully. Expect that the feedback will be considered; even those that may not be adopted.

8. **Inspiration is limited.** Use it well. When you have an inspiration, do not waste it - no matter what time/day it is, try and work on your inspiration. Sometimes you can get days/weeks worth of work in a few inspiration-filled hours. 

	Similarly, on days when you just cannot make progress, feel free to disengage and recharge. Hours on the desk are not helpful if nothing useful is getting done. 

9. **Sharpen your tools often:** Keep getting better at what you do. Read books. Take courses. Practice your art. Don’t be so busy that you cannot spend time on getting better.

10. **Disagree and commit:** Often, we have to take decisions with incomplete data. At some point the benefit of moving forward or launching, outweighs the benefit of waiting for more information. In such cases, multiple paths could make sense. 
	
	It’s important to ensure that all viewpoints are considered. At the same time - decision-making is essential, so for all crucial decisions, there will be an owner. Even if the decision made is not a consensus one, once it’s made, everyone must try to disagree and commit. 
	
	“Disagree and commit” means - I do not necessarily agree with this, however, I commit to back you wholeheartedly and see it to the end. 
	
	Decisions that are reversible, and won’t be very expensive if wrong, must be taken fast. Decisions that are irreversible, or are very expensive if wrong (relative to the size of the company), must be taken slower, with enough consideration.
