# Makkajai is YOU

What most defines Makkajai is the people working with us. You are now a part of Makkajai; you now represent Makkajai - to our customers, to our team mates and to the world in general. 

When a customer gets a support email from Roopesh - Roopesh is Makkajai. 

When one of our team mates gets a helping hand from Deep - Deep is Makkajai. 

When a potential recruit interacts with Christine - Christine is Makkajai. 

**We believe marketing is everyone's responsibility.**

When you design a product to be exceptionally good, when you code our apps to be just right, when you QA and playtest the hell out of our apps - you are ensuring that our customers get a better experience. An experience that hopefully delights them, and excites them enough to share our work with others. While Shashank and Roopesh spend most of their time improving discovery, all of us need to work on earning customer love. 

**What you do defines us.**

If something is broken - **YOU** can fix it. 

If something is not right in the way we do things - **YOU** can change it. 

If there is a better way to do things - **YOU** can introduce it. 

See a problem that you are not sure how to solve? Feel free to bring it up with Roopesh or Deep, at any point. Do not be afraid to have seemingly difficult conversations; the more difficult the conversation, the earlier we should have it.
